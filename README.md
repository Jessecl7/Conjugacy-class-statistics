# Conjugacy-class-statistics
Calculates various permutation statistics on products of Symmetric Group conjugacy classes.  These are mainly related to the number and length of cycles in the permutations, but also relate to inversions and descents.

These were partly coded for a project on conjugacy class statistics, jointly with a group of other graduate students.  See https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00898 and https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11800.
Some of the code also contributed to another joint project with my PhD supervisor, which focused on the average number of cycles, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06659.
